    <h1>PROGRAMMING</h1>
    <p>A programming language is any set of rules that converts strings, or graphical program elements in the
        case of visual programming languages, to various kinds of machine code output.[citation needed]
        Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to
        implement algorithms.</p>

    <p>Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that
        use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Prior to the invention of
        computers, programs were used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and
        player pianos.</p>
